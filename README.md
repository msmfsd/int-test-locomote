Test answers

#### NOTES:
- ES7 syntax is transpiled, however a modern browser is recommended ie Chrome, Safari, FF, Edge
- Materialize and its supporting libs are loaded from a CDN
- Results are displayed in tabs of each airline with flights sorted by cheapest to most expensive
- Click Prev and Next buttons to cycle through previous and next days results
- I just used javascript on front end though for production I would have used React/ReactRouter/Redux/ReduxForm
